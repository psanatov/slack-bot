# Slack bot demo using the RTM API

This simple app demonstrates how to write a simple `Slack` bot using `Slack`'s
[Real-Time Messaging (RTM) API](https://api.slack.com/rtm), [Web API](https://api.slack.com/web) and its official
[node SDK](https://slackapi.github.io/node-slack-sdk/bots).

## Install the bot

1. Go to `Slack API`'s homepage [https://api.slack.com/apps/](https://api.slack.com/apps/) and create a new app.
Install the app with your team.

2. Go to the "Bot Users" section under "Features", and create a new bot user.

3. Go to "Install App" section under "Settings", and note down the Bot User
   OAuth Access Token.  Set the token to the `.env` file.

4. Go to your `Slack`, create a test channel, and invite your bot user to that
   channel.

That's it! Now you can try saying something in the `#channel`. The bot will
mirror whatever you said back to the channel.

## How does it work?

The app creates a websocket connection (through the `Slack SDK`) to `Slack`. It
then registers a handler for any incoming message to any channel it is part of.
To learn more about the SDK, please go to the [official
documentation](https://slackapi.github.io/node-slack-sdk/bots).

## Next steps

There are a lot more you can do with the RTM API, Web API and the SDK! Try to write a
more interesting message handler, or go to the documentation and discover other
events you can register.
